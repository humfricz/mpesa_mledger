# Python Mpesa M-ledger

So over the weekend I learnt Safaricom pulled down the M-ledger app and I was in dire need 
to analyse my M-Pesa transactions and scrolling through the messages wan't going to cut it.
Hence this was born. I used the SMS Backup & Restore app (I am sure there is another app that can do this) 
to backup my mpesa messages into a JSON file and used this script to analyse it

Feel free to make it your own and improve on it.
